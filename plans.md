s# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Planning**

##I need to PLAN##

If I sit down without a plan, I'll waste time. Absolutely. So each day I have to know what I'll do the next two days.

Friday: Finish the PA tutorial and see where it gets me. https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/169/#the-simplest-case-a-script-that-takes-some-inputs-and-returns-an-output

Saturday/ Sunday: Codewars and Advent of Code, for fun? And read study notes.
Or stick to PA, if I'm into it. I want to set up a template for the 'sum' page I just created on PythonAnywhere, and work out how to get the other pages to work. Then I can think about adding the code....

**Topics**
I need to go over a bunch of subjects that I haven't touched in a while - real basics but I find it hard to remember them. So:

enumerate
sort and sorted - silly things I've forgotten
removing things from lists

**Projects**
Countdown to holidays - my holiday at the beach is planned, but how many days do I have to go? Can I email myself every day? Send a photo? I can probably do this from PythonAnywhere. I could use web scraping to include the weather that day at our site, maybe other info. 

Hi Lo game, to practice binary search, and try to add to it, make it more interesting

**PythonAnywhere**
Get the site running, get my code working on it? I'm going to have to
-- finish the tutorial
-- work out how to add new pages? I could do it all on the front page, I suppose
-- get the code running
-- learn some basic html and CSS to make it look better

**Courses**
Udemy - I have a few things saved. Maybe regex next

**Quick things**
If I just want to mess about some days, play with codewars and older Advent of Code.
