s# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've OOPed (kind of) the AoC code from yesterday, added comments, generally tidied up. I've also set up a new repo as the last one was a fork - I didn't realise that won't show up in my Activity. I like green squares :-)
I also moved the AoC code to a separate repo, even if I got muddled and now have a main and a master.

**Thoughts**: I need to improve my tweets! state which day, and that I'm using Python. I also can't keep saving my work in this repo - need to save it elsewhere. And I need to get better at using github.

**Link to work:**  As yesterday and also under a separate AoC repo.

### Day 3: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Five mins this morning muddling with AoC - got to go but I'll come back to it later. Back to it, and waiting five minutes before I can try my AoC answer again. And - it worked! Hurray. (And I've done done part 2! Bit brain melty but easier than the first part)

**Thoughts:** I got in a right mess with slicing. Got to the point where I was looking up regex, when what I was trying to do was really quite simple. Kind of.

**Link to work:** Same AoC code as yesterday - 2020 day 2. Part 1 and part 2!

### Day 2: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I don't have much time today so I've been working on an Advent of Code challenge from last year - day 2. Without success so far!

**Thoughts:** I HAVE managed to do a lot, so I'm pleased with that, but I can't get the final part and it's driving me nuts. I think code is just ... in the wrong place? Nah, it works with the test data so it's something that's different about the main data and not working. Grrrr. Of course, even looking at Reddit for a hint doesn't help as it's all OOP and ... I know I need to get there but it's bewildering.

**Link to work:** I've saved it to a repo on github. Oddly, i was using replit and it stopped working at all - so I switched to Atom. I only use repl when I'm coding on my work computer, so no biggie.

### Day 1: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Epiphany! I got my PythonAnywhere site to work.

**Thoughts:** I went back to a PythonAnywhere site that used to work and now doesn't, and I don't know why. I spent a bit of time muddling with it and looking through the log, but I wasn;t getting far - so I decided to start afresh. (One thing I've noted is that I need a plan for this challenge or I sit down and think 'what will I do?' and get nowhere.)

I'm been working through this and see have a basic site up: https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/169/#the-simplest-case-a-script-that-takes-some-inputs-and-returns-an-output

I have some code - kind of janky code, but code - and I'd really like to get it online. I did have extra pages on this site - not sure why those aren;t working but I'll keep trying

### Day 0: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Getting started!

**Thoughts:** I'm not great with github, so plenty to learn. Getting this set up and reading through my notes to get an ideas where I want to focus

And another hour in the evening, reading through notes. I've been distracted by work (non-coding work) for a few months and I need to refresh a bit. Tomorrow I'll put together a list of things I want to work on.

**Link to work:**
Nothing except this so far, but please check out my introduction. I'm considering a change of career and looking for what to learn next.
