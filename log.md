s# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### May 21, 2023

**Today's progress**
Worked on the Natural Language Processing project in the Udemy course 
I'm following

**Thoughts**
I get stuck a lot. It's frustrating. 
I'm getting better at reading documentation, though.


### May 19, 2023

**Today's progress** I have merged Marseille data sets on trottinettes, 
merged columns, and then created a completely fucked up table out of them. 
I don't know where I've gone wrong - I'll think about it...

**Thoughts**
Part of the problem has to be the giant 'date' numbers I created. 
But there's more than that

### May 18, 2023

**Today's progress** Tidying up github and trying to make it better represent my work. 
Now I should create something new to add to it!

I've been playing with some Marseille city data and trying to analyse it. 
I looked at data from the Opera and other theatres, and also popular
children's names

**Thoughts** It's a lot harder in real life than following tutorials...
And I'm not sure there's that much I can do with it. 
Maybe I can play with cufflinks? Anyway, I've learned plenty this morning. 

### May 17, 2023

**Today's Progress** Studying Data Structures and Algorithms, recursions and Big O.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/algorithms-and-data-structures-free-treehouse-course/

**Thoughts**
I've never really thought much about memory use and time. I mean, 
I was aware it was a 'thing', but when you;re just learning it feels a bit 
distant and irrelevant

### Day ...37, I guess? Or day 1, again. May 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: re-learning how to use github! Authentication 
tokens are the biggest pain in the arse and I went round in a LOT of 
circles working that out
BUT it's working, and I'm uploading html versions on my ML course notes,
so that I can access them from anywhere if I need them 
I worked out - finally - how to view the html files from github, as long as
githack keeps working. 
I forget the buzz of just getting things to work!

**Thoughts** Picking up this log a year later... it's not that I've been doing
nothing, i just kind of forgot about Github! I'm busy studying to
prepare for Microsoft Ecole IA by Simplon (got to get the name right!)
that starts in September. But I should get back on the portfolio site too
Anvil never did work out - maybe I should go back and 
have a look.

### Day 36: March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning to use anvil - it looks pretty useful

**Thoughts**: Maybe this is a better solution for showing my work?

**Link to work:**

### Day 35: February 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Going back over numpy and pandas

**Thoughts**:

**Link to work:**

### Day 34: February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Group capture, find and replace in regex on Udemy course

**Thoughts**:

**Link to work:**

### Day 33: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Studying POSIX extended set of regex on Udemy course

**Thoughts**: I do like regex...

**Link to work:**

### Day 32: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Nothing. Changing things, back and forth, no luck.

**Thoughts**: I need to give up on this and do something else for a while!

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/passgen

### Day 31: February 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A few days off, too busy - but I'm still stumped on this one.

**Thoughts**: I think I'm too hungover for code!

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/passgen

### Day 30: February 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Bit of regex tutorial - no time for anything else due to flat hunting!

**Thoughts**: I do love regex :-)

### Day 29: February 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: It's been a frustrating day! I'm so close, i feel, but my password generator won;t work - and that's having stripped lots of functionality. I'll have to keep trying.

**Thoughts**: ....

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/passgen

### Day 28: February 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I don;t have much time this morning so I've been tidying my flask_app so I can understand it better, and planning ahead what to do next.

**Thoughts**: I want to work on some 'interview challenges', both for learning and for any future interviews. I will create a page on my site that lists useful code and concepts as a sort of crib sheet. I could just do it as a file in PythonAnywhere? As long as I can remember either the password or the site url, all fine!

### Day 27: February 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Improved the database/ scratchpad code so that users have to log in - and noone can come along and just add comments! There's more to do in the tutorial and I will work through it, but maybe it can wait - I ought to work on posting my own code.

**Thoughts**: I'm a bit afraid of trying this with my own code. But I've made a start! I'll have to split out the new passwords and finding them, I think.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the database/ scratchpas code working

**Thoughts**: I ended up swearing a lot! And still need to back it all up. But still - progress.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 25: February 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Nothing is working today - I think I'm too tired!

**Thoughts**: Still need to back it all up.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/conversion

### Day 24: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Conversion page done. It should be easier but each one is hard! I set up a very basic base.html too - something to play with in future.

**Thoughts**: Still need to back it all up.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/conversion

### Day 23: January 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Yippeee! The response page works. i found some code on github that helped me work it out. I had to create a new template for the results, then render_template that - and then include the result=result in that. I've now done 'mode', too, and should be able to do the same with the other tutorial code and then, eventually, my own code. Yay.

**Thoughts**: I'm a bit slow of brain, but get there :-) I think I need to sort out the templates and have a 'base', but it's working for now and I'm afraid to change it! I also need to back up this code to github. Maybe I can do that this afternoon.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/sum

### Day 22: January 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Wow - I just got the input page of /sum working with html template. I can't get the response page to look right - I need to find examples of displaying results. But - good! A bit step forward.

**Thoughts**: Listen to PythonAnywhere guys! I'm a bit amazed at what worked, and frustrated at what didn;t. But - cool.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/sum

### Day 21: January 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Have I just had a breakthrough in understanding? I might have done! But I need more time to experiment than I have right now.

**Thoughts**: PythonAnywhere came back with some genius, if fairly obvious advice - to look at source code. I mean, i have... btu trying again, and looking on github, I feel like maybe I understand more than I did? I have to give it a try. Maybe later, maybe tomorroww.

**Link to work:**  


### Day 20: January 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started a regex course. I've done a bit in the past and liked it, so it's worth trying. I've also altered Judy's countdown, even though she hasn't even booked her trip to Marseille yet!

**Thoughts**: Regex - we'll see. The guy's a bit dull. Oh, and I've found what looks like a good Flask course? Still waiting to hear from PythonAnywhere  

**Link to work:**  Nothing useful!


**Today's Progress**: PythonAnywhere got in touch to welcome me as a new paying customer - and I took the chance to ask about further resources that might get me past my current impasse...
I've also been trying to do more on AoC and getting nowhere. It's a bit dispiriting!

**Thoughts**: I'm keeping my self sane, just.

**Link to work:**  Nothing.

### Day 18: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Back to Python Anywhere! I just tried adding my password generator OOP code to the flask_app, trying to fit it to how other apps work. It didn't work out - and made the whole site display errors. Keep trying...

**Thoughts**: It's been a tough week, lost a friend. But I'm still trying.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com/home

### Day 17: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Advent of Code - I needed a break. This is still frustrating, but I know where I am with Python!

**Thoughts**: Trying to do Day 4 of this year's, the bingo cards. Fiddly...

**Link to work:**

### Day 15: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Flask, jinja, ma heid. I'm slowly learning more and more, but nothing that gets me what I want. So far....

**Thoughts**: Man, I'm having bother with github again. I'm always floundering with it! Just when I think I've got to grips with it. Also, bloody Flask! I never anticipated this rabbit hole.

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 14: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've added some code - a temp conversion - but I haven't learned what I want to learn! Surely I shouldn't have all the code in the main flask_app, but should put it in templates, somehow? I thought that was what I was going to learn. So - more to do.

Oh, and I've upgraded my PythonAnywhere account! That feels like a positive step. And I set up a holiday counter auto email for Judy.

**Thoughts**: Day 14! Wow. I didn't think I'd manage to code every day. I've learned a lot. And flipping github is doing my head in

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 13: January 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: All pages are now working, after a fashion. Oh, except the database one.

**Thoughts**: Flask is starting to make a vague sort of sense. Css, on the other hand...

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com


**Today's Progress**: I've posted the three examples as separate pages now, and they work. Now I need to create other pages, and use templates properly. The pages I previously created don't work anymore - I'll have to go back a step, work out how to link to the tmeplates for those.

**Thoughts**: There are still big gaps in my understanding of what I'm doing here!

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 11: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I worked through the rest of the PythonAnywhere tutorial on hosting code in basic web pages, and I might even understand it :-) I'm going to try posting the three examples as separate pages now, just to get more of a handle on it.

**Thoughts**: I'm not 100% sure I'd be able to adapt this to my own code yet, but maybe? I need to take it slowly. '

**Link to work:** http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 10: January 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Done! The email pulls the data from the OpenWeather API and displays it perfectly.

**Thoughts**: I had to learn to look through the JSON output

**Link to work:** on github, but private

### Day 8: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learning about widgets and embedding in emails. It's not that easy... Oh, but my auto email works! Yippee!

**Thoughts**: I need more time to focus. Now, I want a drink... dry January ends tonight.

**Link to work:** Not on github yet.

### Day 7: January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added the countdown timer to the email text. I've set it up as a recurring task on PythonAnywhere so I hope to get an email in the morning! Wow, hard to believe I've done that, I've wanted to set up a task for a while.

**Thoughts**: That was pretty easy. Now to expand on it and make it better.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/GillianLaw/HolidayCountdown.git

### Day 6: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I worked out how to sort out the gmail settings. Reddit didn't have an answer, but someone's confusion over me question prompted me to find out! I can't get the code samples from RealPython to work - ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'email.mime'; 'email' is not a package That sounds pretty definite! I'll try something else tomorrow - I'm really weary today.

LATER - solved!! Thanks to stack overflow. I had called the file 'email.py' and that was causing the issue. I copied and renamed it - but even having the old version there called email.py still cause the hiccup. Changed it - bingo, the email works!

**Thoughts**: Yay! Thank heavens for stack overflow and someone else making the exact same mistake.

**Link to work:** https://github.com/GillianLaw/HolidayCountdown.git

### Day 5: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I wrote a short bit of code counting down to the holidays - and I'm learning about how to email that to myself. Having trouble with gmail, though - I don't want to reduce my s security on my main account and can't find a way past it.

**Thoughts**: I'm frustrated, but I've asked for help on Reddit

**Link to work:** https://github.com/GillianLaw/HolidayCountdown.git

### Day 4: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I've OOPed (kind of) the AoC code from yesterday, added comments, generally tidied up. I've also set up a new repo as the last one was a fork - I didn't realise that won't show up in my Activity. I like green squares :-)
I also moved the AoC code to a separate repo, even if I got muddled and now have a main and a master.

**Thoughts**: I need to improve my tweets! state which day, and that I'm using Python. I also can't keep saving my work in this repo - need to save it elsewhere. And I need to get better at using github.

**Link to work:**  As yesterday and also under a separate AoC repo.

### Day 3: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Five mins this morning muddling with AoC - got to go but I'll come back to it later. Back to it, and waiting five minutes before I can try my AoC answer again. And - it worked! Hurray. (And I've done done part 2! Bit brain melty but easier than the first part)

**Thoughts:** I got in a right mess with slicing. Got to the point where I was looking up regex, when what I was trying to do was really quite simple. Kind of.

**Link to work:** Same AoC code as yesterday - 2020 day 2. Part 1 and part 2!

### Day 2: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I don't have much time today so I've been working on an Advent of Code challenge from last year - day 2. Without success so far!

**Thoughts:** I HAVE managed to do a lot, so I'm pleased with that, but I can't get the final part and it's driving me nuts. I think code is just ... in the wrong place? Nah, it works with the test data so it's something that's different about the main data and not working. Grrrr. Of course, even looking at Reddit for a hint doesn't help as it's all OOP and ... I know I need to get there but it's bewildering.

**Link to work:** I've saved it to a repo on github. Oddly, i was using replit and it stopped working at all - so I switched to Atom. I only use repl when I'm coding on my work computer, so no biggie.

### Day 1: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Epiphany! I got my PythonAnywhere site to work.

**Thoughts:** I went back to a PythonAnywhere site that used to work and now doesn't, and I don't know why. I spent a bit of time muddling with it and looking through the log, but I wasn;t getting far - so I decided to start afresh. (One thing I've noted is that I need a plan for this challenge or I sit down and think 'what will I do?' and get nowhere.)

I'm been working through this and see have a basic site up: https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/169/#the-simplest-case-a-script-that-takes-some-inputs-and-returns-an-output

I have some code - kind of janky code, but code - and I'd really like to get it online. I did have extra pages on this site - not sure why those aren;t working but I'll keep trying

**Link to work:**
The site: http://gilliancodes.eu.pythonanywhere.com

### Day 0: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Getting started!

**Thoughts:** I'm not great with github, so plenty to learn. Getting this set up and reading through my notes to get an ideas where I want to focus

And another hour in the evening, reading through notes. I've been distracted by work (non-coding work) for a few months and I need to refresh a bit. Tomorrow I'll put together a list of things I want to work on.

**Link to work:**
Nothing except this so far, but please check out my introduction. I'm considering a change of career and looking for what to learn next.
